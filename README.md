# Psychiatry Trainee Supervision Feedback

Trainees are invited to provide quick feedback after every supervision session. This includes a sentence (or a few) of _what they are taking away from today's supervision_, two numeric variables on understanding the patient and the understanding the formulation and an optional text-box on how to improve the supervision process.

Access is built into the supervision WhatsApp group and can be easily provided through a shortlink or a QR code.
